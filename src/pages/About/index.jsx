      <p>Renewable energy is an essential component of sustainable development. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and contribute to environmental degradation, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power offer a clean and sustainable alternative. These energy sources are abundant and can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, helping to combat climate change. By investing in renewable energy, countries can create jobs, enhance energy security, and promote environmental sustainability.</p>
